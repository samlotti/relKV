# We highly  recommend setting a high number for GOMAXPROCS, which  allows Go to observe the full
IOPS throughput provided by modern SSDs. In Dgraph, we have set it to 128.  For more details, see
this thread.

# We recommend setting max file descriptors to a high number depending upon the expected size of
 your data. On Linux and Mac, you can check  the file descriptor limit with ulimit -n -H for the
 hard  limit and ulimit -n -S for  the soft limit.  A soft limit of 65535  is a good lower bound.
 You can adjust the limit as needed.
