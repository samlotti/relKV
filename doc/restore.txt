To restore a backup do the following.

copy the zip or backup file to a folder

in the current relKv directory

./relKv stop

./relKv restore {name of backup file} {name of database for restore}

Note that you cannot restore to an existing database so delete that database directory.
The backup file can be a zip file from the backup. It can only contain a single file.

Can restore to any name of a database. This makes it easy to restore it, try it and then just rename the directory.
