* Create buckets support, also support configuration file buckets.  But bucket list is dynamic so at
  startup scan the data directory for buckets as well as the configuration file.


* add alias to create and delete

* do parent lookup when an alias key is found and return that data.
  considered not found if the parent key is not found.

* provide better testing
